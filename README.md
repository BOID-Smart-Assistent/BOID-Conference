# BOID
The BOID project is a modular system designed to implement and interact with the BOID algorithm, 
providing advanced reasoning capabilities supported by an LLM (Large Language Model). 
The repository is structured as a collection of submodules that can function independently or 
integrate seamlessly in a unified environment through Docker.

## Example
In the appendix you can find a figure that illustrates an example of a process tree that the BOID algorithm generates. The tree structure demonstrates how different scheduling decisions are made based on prioritized rules, showing multiple possible extensions that align with the agent's obligations and desires. [Link](appendix/example.pdf)

## Features

- API: Provides a RESTful interface and frontend to interact with the BOID system.
- BOID Algorithm: Implements the BOID reasoning system, processing rules and 
generating decisions based on default logic.
- LLM Module: Enhances the system with natural language understanding, where the boid rules are generated from
user input.

## Running the project

Before choosing an option, clone the repository.

### Option1: run sub-modules separately

Navigate to the desired module and follow its specific setup instructions in its `README`

### Option 2: run all modules together

1. Start the docker container

You can run it in dev mode or use the production build
- **Development**:
```shell
docker compose up -f docker-compose.dev.yml
```
- **Production**:
```shell
docker compose up -f docker-compose.prod.yml
```

access the system through the browser with the exposed API endpoint (default: `http://localhost:8000`)
